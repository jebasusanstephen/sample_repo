Git and Github configuration:::

Get a github account.
Download and install git.

Set up git with your user name and email.
Open a terminal/shell and type:

$ git config --global user.name "Your name here"
$ git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
(Don’t type the $; that just indicates that you’re doing this at the command line.)


create such public/private keys: Open a terminal/shell and type:

$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"
Copy your public key (the contents of the newly-created id_rsa.pub file) into your clipboard. On a Mac, in the terminal/shell, type:

$ pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
Paste your ssh public key into your github account settings.

Go to your github Account Settings
Click “SSH Keys” on the left.
Click “Add SSH Key” on the right.
Add a label (like “My laptop”) and paste the public key into the big text box.

In a terminal/shell, type the following to test it:

$ ssh -T git@github.com
If it says something like the following, it worked:
Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but Github does
not provide shell access.

cd <cloned_repo>
ls
